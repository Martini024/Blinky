# Blinky Game Engine

**Blinky** is a custom game engine project built from scratch using **Metal** and **SwiftUI**. This project is a personal exploration into the architecture and design of game engines, focusing on rendering, scene management, and advanced real-time graphics techniques.

## Features

- **Basic Rendering Pipeline**: Core engine architecture for handling dynamic 3D environments.
- **Camera System**: Supports multiple view projections for seamless scene navigation.
- **Object Rendering**: Efficient rendering of models and primitives within a scene.
- **Scene Management**: Dynamic control over scenes, objects, and their interactions.
- **Phong Shading**: Realistic lighting with specular highlights for improved object visualization.
- **Event & Input System**: Handles user interactions and game mechanics for responsive gameplay.

## In Progress

- **Multi-Pass Rendering**: Advanced rendering techniques to improve visual effects and performance.
- **Physically Based Rendering (PBR)**: Realistic material rendering for enhanced visual fidelity.
- **Shadow Rendering**: Accurate shadow mapping for dynamic lighting effects.
- **Game Editor**: A custom tool for scene management and real-time editing capabilities.
- **Scene Persistency**: Saving and loading of scenes for continued gameplay sessions.

## Motivation

Blinky is a personal exploration project aimed at understanding how game engines work by implementing key components from the ground up. The project continues to evolve as I explore advanced techniques in real-time rendering and game engine development.
